======

Beam finite element model implemented in Python, used by
[mbwind](https://github.com/ricklupton/mbwind). Allows for rotated
elements with linearly varying properties.

The element matrices are derived in
[theory/FE element matrices.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ricklupton/beamfe/blob/master/theory/FE%20element%20matrices.ipynb).
